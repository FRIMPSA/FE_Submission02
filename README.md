Freddy loves Halloween. He loves it so much that he decided to open his own online artisanal Halloween candy shop last year.
The shop was a huge success, thanks to the unique and exclusive candy stock list. Now Freddy needs a simple web app to manage his candy orders.


#Overview
The Application has three views which include:
1. The login page
2. Dashboard
3. Orders page
Note: The Application uses a jws authentication tokens which expires in every 15min so there is the need to keep updating the token through out
 the program to enable it fetch the data efficiently from the server.

#Architecture and  Libraries
1. Chart.js
2. Bootstrap
3. Vanilla javascript
4. css

#Login
The login will return to the console a login and a refresh token which expires in 15 minutes. 


#Dashboard
The dashboard makes a graph with chart.js with dataset from the API. The dataset is of two types, one showing weekly records and another showing a yearly records. The toggle button switches data from weekly records to yearly when clicked.
below the graph is a table fetching 'bestsellers' data in to the table.


#Orders
The order page shows a table of data from the API which shows paginaton and a search or filter functionality. the table can be sorted in both ascending and descending order. Data in the table can be filtered by name or status. The table can display 10 rows at a time but can also display 20 or 30 rows as well.
